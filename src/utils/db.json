      "The missing part of any JWT courses. Thank you.",
      "I know everyone is hyping that don’t store tokens in local or session storage. But the reality is if your application is vulnerable to XSS attacks then an attacker can high jacks your tokens stored even in http only cookie by triggering an fetch request to his malicious domain with credentials set to true. So I personally think that we should give more focus on preventing any sort of XSS vulnerabilities in our site rather than deciding where we store our tokens. Personally I prefer session storage as it expires when user closes browser tab. Also please note that I am not saying that author is completely wrong. This is a good quality video. Just saying that this approach will also fails if we have XSS vulnerability.",
      "Hello Franz, very nice video!! Great content too! However, you left out something. The cookie holding the refresh token is still susceptible to CSRF attacks. And once that happens, it’s game over. HttpOnly alone won’t save the cookie from CSRF attacks. You need additional settings on the refresh-token cookie  for GraphQL. Namely: Path: /graphql; Domain: localhost:4500; SameSite: Strict. Now, with these additional settings, the refresh-token cookie is not vulnerable to CSRF via abuse of ambient authority on cross-site, cross-domain scenarios",
      "Damnn!! this is what every JWT newbie needs to know how to understand the refresh token & its usage in the front end . Thank you Sir!!!",
      "This was/is a phenomenal video.  Though not titled microservices, this is the only video that I've found that helped me with the front end side of handling APIs.  Thank you for making this.",
      "Important thing to highlight that such an approach is great for web browser applications but not a good idea to follow it if we are creating same Auth API for IOS or Android as they don't have the cookies mechanism.",
      "This is the best I have watch so far on jwt auth.",
      "I searched a lot about these refresh token and access token, finally, I understood what's going on. Thank you sir",
      "You went the extra mile. All the rest in YouTube were lazy or lacking of knowledge or maybe just not as clear as you are. Thanks for your video man!",
      "Thanks for the kind words, I'm always happy to help! Let  know if you'd like any videos on specific topics in the future. I wish you all the",
      "tysm almost a week I searching about the refresh token huhu finally you saved me tysm!",
      "I do not understand why people completely stopped talking about CSRF-attacks. Developers actually stopped using httpOnly cookies and went for localStorage for a reason. Cookies, httpOnly or not, are very much prone to an attack. They are not prone to an XSS-attack but they are prone to a CSRF-attack. localStorage are not prone to CSRF though. And if XSS does happen then even with well protected cookies an attacker has huge power and still is able to make a lot of damage.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with storing tokens in local storage. If your site has XSS vulnerabilities, you have much bigger issues.",
      "'in this tutorial' <3 great vid Kati! thx",
      "Thank you for addressing this topic, there is a lot of misinformation out there. :)",
      "Huh, that was very useful. Thank you. You may have just saved my ass :D",
      "Problem with this method is, if someone gets the refresh token, they may infinitely keep on getting new tokens. \nOne would say, to tackle this issue, keep the expiry time of small duration. \nHowever, it’ll create another issue. Suppose, if I shut down my system and come back the next day, the refresh token would have expired by now. Therefore, I’ll have to log in again. \nWhat could be the potential solution to such problems?",
      "Thanks so much! Every time was missing why the refresh token is even should be used",
